# Neural_network_excercise
A simple Neural Network to begin understanding the workings of Tensorflow
The project was developed for COMP9444

The nueral network is designed to be trained using the MNIST data set and trained to recognise digit
The network compares the advantages of increasing the depth of nueral networks and the higher degree
of accuracy when implementing a convulutional network.
The networks should all get above 90+ accuracy within a few iterations.
- One layer should acheive 92% within 5 iterations
- Two layer shows an improvement on the one layer network.
- Conv should achieve about 95% accuracy within first iteration.

Usage python train.py {ID} {conv/twolayer/onelayer}
ID only important when running on the UNSW environment
